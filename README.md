# Supervised-Learning
Healthcare

CONTEXT: Medical research university X is undergoing a deep research on patients with certain conditions.
University has an internal AI team. Due to confidentiality the patientâ€™s details and the conditions are masked by
the client by providing different datasets to the AI team for developing a AIML model which can predict the
condition of the patient depending on the received test results.

PROJECT OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate the ability to fetch, process and leverage data to generate useful predictions
by training Supervised Learning algorithms.
